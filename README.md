<h1>The Agile Process</h1>

<p>The Agile process is the heart of any flexable and responcive software engeneering company.<br>
"Agile is not a methodology it is a psychology"<br> Agile sits in contrast to the 'big design up-front' approach of "give us Â£8M to build a system and we'll see you in two years with something that might work".</p>

<h2>Agile Process</h2>

<p>There are many techniques associated with agile development such as programming in pairs, performing code reviews, scrum, kanban, test driven development (TDD) and behaviour driven development (BDD); however none of these alone "is" Agile. They are all techniques that might be selected in the Agile planning process.<br> Agile itself does not specify that one particular technique or another should be used. Agile specifies that a team should pick from the available techniques, execute the plan, and then reflect on the extent to which the team moved towards their goals, ideally with a quantifiable measurement of their progress. During the reflection phase different techniques can be dropped, started, modified, tweaking; whatever the team thinks will best help them move towards their goal.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that changes should be made carelessly or quickly.<br> It is best to avoid making too many changes in the process at one time because otherwise it is difficult to determine which change led to any benefits or deficits. The critical component is that all members of the team are clear about what is being changed for what reason and everyone has agreed to give the changes a try.</p>
